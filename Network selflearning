Chapter 1 Computer networks and internet

1.1 What is internet
Define of network: (1) Hardware and software description (2) Services description

Define of protocol: Defines the format and order of messages, and the actions taken in responese to these behavior.

1.2 The Network Edge
End systems/ host

1.2.1 Access Networks

Home network: DSL and Cable

Downstream/Upstream channel.

FTTH, fiber to the home.
Active Optical networks / Passive Optical Networks

Ethernet in LAN
WIFI

1.2.2 Physical Media
Transmission media

Guided media: fiber
Unguided media: wireless LAn/digital satellite channel

1.3 The Network Core

1.3.1 Packet Switching
Messages from source are broken into packets, and packets are transmitted to destination. 

Store and Forward Transmission
For a path with N links, each of rate of R, and packets size of L, number of P, the delay end-to-end delay is:
d = (N+P-1)L/R

Queuing Delays and Packet Loss

Output buffer/queue, queuing delays, packet loss

Forwarding Tables and Routing Protocols

1.3.2 Circuit Switching

Circuit switching and packet switching are two ways to move data.

Multiplexing in Circuit-Switched Networks

Frequency-division multiplexing: Frequency spectrum is divided. Bandwidth FM raio stations.
Time-division multiplexing: Time is divided. Slot, Frame.

Packet Switching VS. Circuit Switching

Circuit switching: Need Reservation, rate guaranteed, allocated, not considering of demand;
Packet switching: No Reservation, rate not guaranteed, on demand.

1.3.3 A Network of Networks

Network Structure 1: all of the access ISPs (Customer) are connected with a single global transit ISP (Provider.).

Network Structure 2: Single to multiple global transit ISPs, which are interconnected as well.

Network Structure 3: Multi-tier hierarchy.
Access ISP, connected to Regional ISP, connected to T1 ISPs (global)
Or Access ISP connected to T1 ISP.

Network Structure 4: ISPs in Structure 3 and following points.
Points of presence (POPs):a group of one or more routers in Provider's network, to connect customer ISPs.
                          No bottom level (access ISP)
Multi-homing: ISP can connect to two or more provider ISPs.
             No T1 ISPs
Peering: customer ISPs in same level connect to each other directly, without paying to each other.
Internet exchange points (IXPs): a meeting point created by a third-party, to peer multiple IPSPs.

Network Structure 5: On top of Network Structure 4, Content provider is added, which can bypass T1 ISP.

1.4 Delay, Loss and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks

1.4.1 Overview of Delay
Nodal delay: nodal processing delay, queuing delay, transmission delay, propagation delay.
