Chapter 1 Computer networks and internet

1.1 What is internet
Define of network: (1) Hardware and software description (2) Services description

Define of protocol: Defines the format and order of messages, and the actions taken in responese to these behavior.

1.2 The Network Edge
End systems/ host

1.2.1 Access Networks

Home network: DSL and Cable

Downstream/Upstream channel.

FTTH, fiber to the home.
Active Optical networks / Passive Optical Networks

Ethernet in LAN
WIFI

1.2.2 Physical Media
Transmission media

Guided media: fiber
Unguided media: wireless LAn/digital satellite channel

1.3 The Network Core

1.3.1 Packet Switching
Messages from source are broken into packets, and packets are transmitted to destination. 

Store and Forward Transmission
For a path with N links, each of rate of R, and packets size of L, number of P, the delay end-to-end delay is:
d = (N+P-1)L/R

Queuing Delays and Packet Loss

Output buffer/queue, queuing delays, packet loss

Forwarding Tables and Routing Protocols

1.3.2 Circuit Switching

Circuit switching and packet switching are two ways to move data.

Multiplexing in Circuit-Switched Networks

Frequency-division multiplexing: Frequency spectrum is divided. Bandwidth FM raio stations.
Time-division multiplexing: Time is divided. Slot, Frame.

Packet Switching VS. Circuit Switching

Circuit switching: Need Reservation, rate guaranteed, allocated, not considering of demand;
Packet switching: No Reservation, rate not guaranteed, on demand.

1.3.3 A Network of Networks

Network Structure 1: all of the access ISPs (Customer) are connected with a single global transit ISP (Provider.).

Network Structure 2: Single to multiple global transit ISPs, which are interconnected as well.

Network Structure 3: Multi-tier hierarchy.
Access ISP, connected to Regional ISP, connected to T1 ISPs (global)
Or Access ISP connected to T1 ISP.

Network Structure 4: ISPs in Structure 3 and following points.
Points of presence (POPs):a group of one or more routers in Provider's network, to connect customer ISPs.
                          No bottom level (access ISP)
Multi-homing: ISP can connect to two or more provider ISPs.
             No T1 ISPs
Peering: customer ISPs in same level connect to each other directly, without paying to each other.
Internet exchange points (IXPs): a meeting point created by a third-party, to peer multiple IPSPs.

Network Structure 5: On top of Network Structure 4, Content provider is added, which can bypass T1 ISP.

1.4 Delay, Loss and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks

1.4.1 Overview of Delay
Nodal delay: 
nodal processing delay (us): examine the packet's header and destination direaction, check for bit-level errors.
                             After this, packet is directed to the queue.
***queuing delay (us to ms): waiting to be transmitted. Vary from packet to packet.  
transmission delay (us to ms): L/R, whole packet transmitted from A to B. Packet length and rate
propagation delay(ms): time for a bit travels from A to B. Distance.

1.4.2 Queuing delay and packet loss

Traffic intensity: La/R.
L: packet size; a: packet coming rate; R:transmission rate.

Packet Loss, due to the full of buffer.

1.4.3 End to End Delay
Including N-1 routers, source and destination.

Trace-route Program: Source sends N packets to a destination, and each router and destination will send message back to confirm receive it; So the source can reconstruct the delivery path.

End system, application, and other delays
Delay by design.

1.4.4 Throughput in Computer Networks
As the transmission rates are different in each segment of path, it has a bottleneck link.

1.5 Protocol Layers and Their service models

1.5.1 Layered Architecture

Layer: provide the same service to the layer above it, and uses same services from the layer below it.
Remained of the system remains unchanged when a layer's implementation is changed.

Protocol Layering

Protocols in layer: each protocol belongs to one of the layers;
Service model: services that a layer offers to the layer above.

Physical -> Link -> Network -> Transport ->(Session) -> (Presentation) -> Applilcation
(Hardware)          (Mixed)    (Software)

Pro: easier to update
Con: duplicate function; one layer need information from other

Protocol stack.

APPLICATION LAYER
Application layer: network applications and their application layer protocols reside.
 
Examples: HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS, etc...
Message: packet of information exchanged at the application layer.

Transport Layer
Transport Layer: transport application layer messages between app endpoints.

Examples: TCP and UDP.

TCP: Connection-oriented, guaranteed delivery, flow control, breaks long message into shorter segment.
UDP: Connectionless, no-frill, no flow control, no congestion control.

Network Layer (IP layer)
Network Layer: move network-layer packets (datagrams) from one host to another.

Examples: IP, and routing protocols.

Link Layer
Link Layer: provide service to move a packet from one node to next.
IP layer passes the datagram down to the link layer, and deliver it to next.

Examples: Ethernet, WiFi, DOCSIS, etc...

A datagram may be handled by several link layer protocols.

Link layer packets: frames.

Physical Layer
Physical Layer: move the individual bits within the frame from one node to the next.

Examples: several protocols in Ethernet, etc...

Depend on medium, link.

The OSI Model

Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, with 7 layers.

Physical -> Link -> Network -> Transport ->(Session) -> (Presentation) -> Applilcation
(Hardware)          (Mixed)    (Software)

Presentation layer: allow communicating applications to interpret the meaning of data exchanged.
Data compression and data encryption. 
Format free for data represented/stored?

Session layer: delimite and synchronization of data exchange.
For save and backup?

Up to the application developer to design function.
